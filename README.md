This is a simple note-taking application for markdown and .txt notes based on modern web technologies like React, Electron, and Node.js. It provides file editing and a live Markdown previews for local files. 


I used this project to learn React and Electron with minimal knowledge of both before I started. As a result of this, the project is a mess and could use some major work. 

If you're brave enough, feel free to contribute.
